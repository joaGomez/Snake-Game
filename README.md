# Snake-Game

Hi, i present to you the snake game project made with python. At the moment, i'm still working at the project, making changes and improvements. Hope you enjoy it and be aware for the next updates. Moreover, you can read the list of instructions below on how this project is set.

The_Snake_Game.exe is an application compiled with NSIS which will help you to install the game without downloading every archive. With this application, you only have to install, and after you installed it and opened the folder it has been created, you only have to click main.exe and you will be playing the game.

Also, you can take a look at the source code which is in the folder The_Snake_Game. Furthermore, if your intentions are looking more deeply into the code, you can do it. There is a folder apart from this readme and The_Snake_Game.exe, called Snake_Game_Source_Code. There is complete access to the files which i'm working on.
